# Ali-Portfolio

Hello World!

This is my personal portfolio where I display my coding projects and skills.

My portfolio website has been designed using an extensive amount of HTML AND SCSS with a touch of JavaScript to bring about fun animations for an enjoyable UI and UX.

My portfolio incorporates of all the enticing and intellectually stimulating projects I've taken upon and will soon be updated by far more.
